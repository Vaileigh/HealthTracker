# HealthTracker

Our main objective is to create a functional, practical application to track the health of users of the App. The app will require the User creates an account and inputs various personal data, which will be stored and tracked for the user to motivate themselves and contemplate their progress. A brief look into appâ€™s similar to the goal of out app shows complicated apps that overburden users with dozens of features they will likely not use- and a surprising amount do little to track both diet and exercise. So our app will focus on simplicity and minimalism, whilst also offering users a diary to track their daily calories, and exercise goals, and options to share goals and data with a Social group feature.
