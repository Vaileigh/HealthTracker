# HealthTracker

Most complex pages:
[LQ]Account creation- a lot to keep in mind, exceptions thorwn if the username is taken, verifying email addresses and sending emails
Goals- a bit complex, goals should be a class with groupgoals being a subclass, goals should be adjustable so users can choose their targets
[XO]Groups- another complex one, this page needs different options if the user is a group admin
[AM]Data display- this won't be fully ready until we know exactly all the data and how we'll store it but can build the page with some practise kind of data.Can show various user stats like steps, calories or weight loss over past [amount of time]

Less complex pages: 
Calories Log- Some graph here in the immediate page, not too complex 
[JJ]Excersice Log- Maybe a simple graph here too of recent excercise data, 
Settings page- can be used to alter user data like preffered units and font size
Home page: Similar to Jacob's prototype, general information, goals close to etc.
